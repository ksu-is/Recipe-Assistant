# Recipe Assistant Project Roadmap
## Sprint 1
- [x] Find related repository
> Found two related repositories - https://github.com/Sushmey/RecipeByIngredients and https://github.com/ankitgoyal0301/Homemade-RecipeBowl-Your-Ingredients-Our-Recipes

> Users are able to input ingredients, and related recipes containing these ingredients are found. Program searches the web (?) to find these recipes, I may instead just code in a few recipes and have the program search only those
- [x] Link to current depository
