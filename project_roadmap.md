# Recipe Assistant Project Roadmap
## Sprint 1
- [x] Find related repository
> Found two related repositories - https://github.com/Sushmey/RecipeByIngredients and https://github.com/ankitgoyal0301/Homemade-RecipeBowl-Your-Ingredients-Our-Recipes
- [x] Evaluate and understand code
> Users are able to input ingredients, and related recipes containing these ingredients are found. Program searches the web (?) to find these recipes, I may instead just code in a few recipes and have the program search only those
- [x] Link to current depository
> Listed above
## Sprint 2
- [x] Plan code structure
> Basic code structure created
- [x] Begin coding
> Functions, lists, user inputs, etc. created, but not fully functional
- [x] Add comments and documentation
> Code documented, easy to follow along, and planned additions listed in comments
- [x] Finish first half (prompts user for ingredients)
> Code prompts user for ingredients, as well as exits upon user request
- [x] Test for bugs, documenting problem areas
> Infinite loop found
- [x] Fix bugs, documenting the error and how it was solved
> Solved infinite loop, added necessary break
## Sprint 3
- [ ] Finish second half (outputs potential recipes)
- [ ] Add comments and documentation
- [ ] Test for bugs, documenting problem areas
- [ ] Fix bugs, documenting the error and how it was solved
